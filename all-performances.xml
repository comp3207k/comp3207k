The attraction between them is immediate, and Jane more than holds her own against his fierce intellect. Stephen&apos;s advanced ideas about theoretical physics and cosmology also impress his tutor, Dennis Sciama (David Thewlis).

For his 1987 production, Anthony Dowell went back to the choreography originally created by the great Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov for the Mariinsky Theatre in 1895. Yolanda Sonnabend&apos;s inspired designs draw on the Russian Imperial Court of the period, blending historical accuracy and gothic fantasy.

The attraction between them is immediate, and Jane more than holds her own against his fierce intellect. Stephen&apos;s advanced ideas about theoretical physics and cosmology also impress his tutor, Dennis Sciama (David Thewlis). But then he&apos;s given a devastating diagnosis of motor neurone disease and told he has just two years to live. Jane draws on her inner strength to stand by the man she loves as they face the future together. Oscar-winning &apos;Man on Wire&apos; director James Marsh has a flair for telling incredible true stories. Adapted from Jane Hawking&apos;s memoir, this is a deeply moving, nuanced drama that doesn&apos;t shy away from the Hawkings&apos; marital difficulties.

It has crossed over into popular culture and been radically reinterpreted many times. From the earliest days of the Vic-Wells Ballet, it has also been one of The Royal Ballet&apos;s signature works. For his 1987 production, Anthony Dowell went back to the choreography originally created by the great Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov for the Mariinsky Theatre in 1895. Yolanda Sonnabend&apos;s inspired designs draw on the Russian Imperial Court of the period, blending historical accuracy and gothic fantasy.

So when the Capulets organise a masked ball in honour of their daughter Juliet, Romeo Montague and his friend Mercutio attend incognito. The young couple fall hopelessly in love, but soon realise that they belong to rival houses. Written in 1595, William Shakespeare&apos;s timeless tragic love story was the inspiration for Prokofiev&apos;s much-loved ballet, which is packed with famous melodies. Its centrepiece is the instantly recognisable, supremely dramatic &apos;Dance of the Knights&apos;, which was appropriated as the theme tune for &apos;The Apprentice&apos;.

As memories of conflict give way to a life of parties and masked balls, Claudio and Hero fall madly, deeply in love, while Benedick and Beatrice reignite their own altogether more combative courtship.Shakespeare&apos;s comic romance plays out amidst the brittle high spirits of a post-war house party, as youthful passions run riot, lovers are deceived and happiness is threatened - before peace ultimately wins the day.Christopher Luscombe directs the second of Shakespeare&apos;s matching pair of comedies that rejoice in our capacity to find love in the most unlikely places.

His only chance of salvation is through the faithful love of a good woman. On learning that Daland has a young daughter, Senta (Adrianne Pieczonka), he offers great riches for her hand in marriage. Wagner&apos;s first significant opera, this romantic masterpiece explores the themes of damnation and redemption that would continue to preoccupy the composer.

Only at the end of the play is the merriment curtailed as the lovers agree to submit to a period apart, unaware that the world around them is about to be utterly transformed by the war to end all wars.Christopher Luscombe directs one acting company in both Love&apos;s Labour&apos;s Lost and Love&apos;s Labour&apos;s Won (usually known as Much Ado About Nothing). " cast=""><shows /></film><film title="ROH - Andrea Chenier" rating="12A" release="29/01/2015" length="150 mins" url="/whatson/roh-andrea-chenier?cinema=22" edi="446056" poster="/assets/media/films/7330_poster.jpg" director="" synopsis="David McVicar revives Giordano&apos;s great historical opera of ill-fated love in a spectacular new production.During the French revolution, noblewoman Maddalena (Eva-Maria Westbroek) falls for the charms of poet Andrea Chenier (Jonas Kaufmann).
